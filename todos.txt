1. Need to present two buttons on the manager gateway: accept and reject. When either of them is clicked, the an update should happen to the django model in the backend without redirecting the user to another page.
This will require javascript & fetch.

2. In addition we need to allow the manager to add a comment that again has to get stored onto the model without causing a page redirect.
